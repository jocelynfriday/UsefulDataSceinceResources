# Useful Data Science Resources
Papers and resources that I've found to be particularly useful for health data science research (including stats, epidemiology, coding, etc.)

## Statistics
### General
* Frank Harrell's author checklist: https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/author-checklist/3407 
### Time-to-event analysis

#### Survival Analysis
* A useful introduction to survival analysis with R code and examples: https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/survival_analysis_in_r_tutorial.html#Part_1:_Introduction_to_Survival_Analysis

#### Multistate analysis

##### Visualisation
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mstate/vignettes/visuals_demo.html

#### Competing Risks
* A well-written practical guide for reporting using the Fine-Grey model for competing risks; Fine of Fine and Gray is an author https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.7501  

### Splines 
* Review of spline options, handy for mathematical underpinnings: https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-019-0666-3

## Epidemiology

### Incidence & Prevalence
* Prevalent cases in observational studies -  https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2695697/
* Calculating incidence rates and prevalence proportions - https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/219687452.pdf
* Useful for explanation of incidence rate calculation using look-back periods (see supplementary materials Figure S1): https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034986#abstract

## Coding
* A useful book with R code and examples: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/

## Electronic Patient record recording
* Systematic review of the different definitions of major adverse cardiovascular event definitions (MACE): https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-021-01440-5
